This challenge consists in predicting the sale price of a house based on 79 explanatory variables of the characteristics/conditions of the property. For more details about the challenge, visit: [House Prices Challenge(https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)]
To solve this challenge, I apply a random forest regressor. 
I select relevant columns based on how much information they share with column containing the known sale price from the training data set.
